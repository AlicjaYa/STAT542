# STAT542 Project: Image Classification of CIFAR-10 Using CNNs

## Introduction
This project implements and compares two powerful convolutional neural network architectures, DenseNet and ResNet, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. Our goal is to demonstrate the efficacy of these models in classifying these images into their respective categories.
